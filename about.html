          API Law Office, and its name
        </h3>
        <hr class="content-block__hr"/>
        <p class="content-block__text">
          Founded in San Francisco, API Law Office specializes in U.S. immigration law and serves companies
          and entrepreneurs to acquire appropriate visa and/or green card in order to establish their businesses
          in the U.S. API Law Office also serves individuals to acquire family-based green card as well as U.S.
          citizenship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The firm name “API” represents the founder’s two passions. First, API is an abbreviation of “All Peoples’
          Immigration.” We hope to serve everyone across countries and cultures who strives for their career and
          life in the U.S. Second, API is also an abbreviation of the tech term “Application Programming Interface”
          which is a tool/function that enables programmers to create their own applications much more efficiently
          and easily. We hope to become the API of the complex U.S. immigration system for our clients, so that they
          can acquire their visa/green card more efficiently and easily.

          Our Values
        </h3>
        <hr class="content-block__hr"/>
        <p class="content-block__text">
          <strong>Efficiency: </strong>We value our clients’ time and would rather have them spend more time on their business or family
          than to have them worry about the complex immigration process. Therefore, we strive to make the process as
          efficient and easy as possible for our clients
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Relationship: </strong>We believe a truly successful case comes from an open and trusting relationship between the client
          and attorney. We face our clients with transparency, honesty, and care, with the hope to truly understand the
          client’s goals and build an application strategy that will be the most beneficial to the client. We strongly
          encourage our clients to ask any questions and make any suggestions or criticisms so that we can build a
          strong relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Education: </strong>We want to be a resource to everyone who struggles with the complex U.S. immigration system. We offer
          our first consultation for free with the hope that people can be better informed and make better decisions. We also
          offer seminars and meetup sessions so that more people can have the opportunity to learn about U.S. immigration system.

        <h3 class="content-block__title">The Founder</h3>
        <hr class="content-block__hr"/>
        <p class="content-block__text">
          Born in Shanghai, China, Yan emigrated to Japan when she was 8 years old. After graduating high school in Hiroshima, Japan, Yan
          came to the U.S. as an international student. Her own immigration experience coupled with her witnessing foreigners’ struggle
          with immigration status in the U.S. drove her to become an immigration attorney. After graduating from University of California,
          Los Angeles (UCLA), Yan took advantage of the Optional Practical Training (OPT) system to gain practical experience at an immigration
          law firm as a legal assistant. After OPT, Yan entered Santa Clara University, School of Law where she worked on various immigration
          cases with the law school’s affiliated immigration clinic as well as non profit organizations. She also represented a client on an
          asylum case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and successfully negotiated for prosecutorial discretion
          with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating from law school and acquiring her attorney license in 2013, Yan began her career as an immigration attorney with a
          law firm exclusively specializes in U.S. immigration law. As the managing attorney at the law firm’s Silicon Valley branch office,
          Yan had the opportunity to work with a number of companies and entrepreneurs who were starting their new businesses in the U.S. Getting
          visas for new companies can be very challenging, but Yan found the joy and passion in serving these clients who strive for success with
          their own passion and mission. In January 2018, Yan founded API Law Office with her passion in providing immigration services with high
          quality, high efficiency, and high value.
